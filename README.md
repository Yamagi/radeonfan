# Fan control daemon for Radeon GPUs

This a daemon to control the fan speed of Radeon video cards. Currently
it's only tested with an Radeon RX 580, it should work with all cards /
GPUs supported by the `amdgpu` driver.

**ATTENTION**: Changing the fan speeds of your video card may overheat
or even destroy your card! This tool comes without any warranty, if it
destroys your hardware that's your and only your fault!


## Inner Workings

All GCN based Radeon video cards offer two ways for fan control:

* **Firmware**: The fan is controlled by logic implemented in the video
  cards firmware. This mode is usually extremely conservative, most
  cards start at about 30% PWM and max out at 100% PWM somewhere around
  75째C.
* **Software**: The fan is controlled by software. The video cards
  provides a fan curve to the software, but the software may ignore it
  and do whatever it wants.

The card starts in firmware mode. Under Windows the driver switches it
to software mode as soon as Windows has booted to the desktop. The Linux
driver has no software fan control, so the card stays in firmware mode.

The Windows driver is rather conservative. It reads three tuples of GPU
temperature and corresponding PWM speed from the cards ROM. This is the
default fan curve: `(tmp0,pwm0)`, `(tmp1,pwm1)` and `(tmp2,pwm2)` For
temperatures up to `tmp0` the fan stays at `pwm0`, for temperatures
between `tmp0` and `tmp1` at `pwm1`, etc. The fan speeds up as soon as a
temperature point is reached and slows only  down to the next slower
level if the temperature falls about 15째C to 20째C under the next lower
temperature point.

We're taking a more aggressive approach: Up to `tmp0` the fan stays as
`pwm0`. Between `tmp0` and `tmp1` it's set to linear interpolated values
between `pwm0` and `pwm1`, the same goes to `tmp1` and `tmp2`. Above
`tmp2` it's always set to `pwm2`. The fan speed is increased as the
temperature rises and only decreased if the temperature has fallen by at
least 5째C. With this, the card is less noisy then under Windows, but the
temperatures are comparable.


## Installation

If your distro has a package you likely want to use that. A precompiled
binary of the latest release can be found under the *release* tab above.
To compile the program by yourself:

* You'll need `go` 1.12 or higher.
* `cd src/`, `go build radeonfan`

Copy the binary were you want it, alter `misc/radeonfan.service` to suit
your needs. Copy it to `/etc/systemd/system`, enable and start it as
usual.


## Command Line Arguments

* **-debug**: Print fan speed changes.
* **-pwm0** and **-tmp0**: First temperature / PWM tuple.
* **-pwm1** and **-tmp1**: Second temperature / PWM tuple.
* **-pwm2** and **-tmp2**: Third temperature / PWM tuple.
* **-pwmmodectrl**: Control file for PWM mode.
* **-pwmspeedctrl**: Control file for PWM speed.
* **-tempctl**: Control file for GPU temperature.


## FAQ

Can I use the default temperature / PWM tuples?
* Maybe, it depends on your card. The default values are taken from an
  *Power Color Radeon RX 580 Red Dragon V2 Active*. 

Okay, were do I get the tuples for my card?
* They can be read from the cards ROM (also known as the BIOS). Ask
  Google for details.
